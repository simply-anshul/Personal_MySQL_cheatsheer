# Personal_MySQL_cheatsheer

I created this project to keep as a cheatsheet for MySQL query and commands. 
i have completed the course "The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert" by Colt Steele. I find this 20.5 hrs course very useful since I did not have much knowledge about Databases and how to interact with them. It is beginner friendly and by the end of the course you can find yourself comfortable with MySQL queries.

To Anshul,
Go throught the concepts and commands. They are easy to understand and you can revise each very concept within an hour. All the best.
