#**Types of Keys** 
##Super Key:
    Super set of the keys
##Candidate Key:
    A key representing the field in the table that can uniquely identify the table. Can be used as a Primary Key
##Primary Key:
    A key representing the field in the table that can identify the the table uniquely. Only one candidate key can be Primary Key. Cannot be null.
##Alternate Key:
    A key that is a candidate key but not primary key.
##Composite/Compound Key:
    Combination of one or more fields of a table. 
##Unique Key:
    It is like Primary key but it can have one null value.
#Foreign Key:
    Foreign Key is the primary key of the other table.

(In DBMS Primary Key, Foreign Key and Unique Key are useful. Other keys are the concepts of RDBMS).

#Normalization:
Converting the database design into the standard form.
There are 5 Normal Forms.
##1NF
    Each set of column uniquely identify the row.
##2NF
    1NF +  all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key
##3NF
    2NF + no transitive relation (A -> B -> C -> therefore A->C should be eliminated)
##BCNF
    BCNF is the advance version of 3NF. It is stricter than 3NF. A table is in BCNF if every functional dependency X → Y, X is the super key of the table. For BCNF, the table should be in 3NF, and for every FD, LHS is super key.
##4NF
    A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd normal form and has no multi-valued dependency. For a dependency A → B, if for a single value of A, multiple values of B exists, then the relation will be a multi-valued dependency.
##5NF
    A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and not contains any join dependency and joining should be lossless. 5NF is satisfied when all the tables are broken into as many tables as possible in order to avoid redundancy. 5NF is also known as Project-join normal form (PJ/NF).
